    <h2>Credits</h2>
    <p>I'd like to thank <a href="https://github.com/zkjellberg">Zachary Kjellberg</a> and <a href="https://github.com/smcnabb">Stephen McNabb</a>, the creators of the original cheat sheets that inspired this project. The guide uses <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Wiki">Fextralife</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Eldenpedia">Eldenpedia</a> for most of its information, along with Map Genie's fantastic <a href="https://mapgenie.io/elden-ring/maps/the-lands-between">Elden Ring Map</a> to visualize item locations, ensuring everything is included. The beginning walkthrough sections loosely follow Cowboy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7RtZMiaOk8gdRf130w4gFYyhstL-5VRh">walkthrough</a> for a head start to make your experience much more approachable, and lastly thanks to <a href="#">Rin</a> for designing the website's favicon and open graph image.</p>
    <h2 class="faq-title">FAQ</h2>
    <h3>How do I use the cheat sheet?</h3>
    <p>This project is a lightweight collection of checklist sheets, covering everything from single item pickups, NPCs, questlines, bosses, achievements and much more. <span class="strong">If this is your first playthrough, I highly recommend that you complete the game on your own first, then use the cheat sheets for your second playthrough instead.</span></p>
    <p>In the <a href="/sheets/resources.html">Resources</a> sheet, you can find helpful info about soft caps, upgrade tables, rune item values and more.</p>
    <p>In the main <a href="/sheets/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a> sheet, you have a step-by-step checklist guide through the entire game, covering as much as possible in just one playthrough.
    <p>If you're not interested in a guided approach, but still want to make sure you don't miss any important questlines or bosses, try the <a href="/sheets/questlines.html">Questlines</a> or <a href="/sheets/bosses.html">Bosses</a> sheets instead.</p>
    <p>The <a href="/sheets/achievements.html">Achievements</a> sheet can be used to track what achievements and legendary items you're missing.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the <a href="/sheets/armaments.html">Armaments</a>, <a href="/sheets/armor.html">Armor</a>, <a href="/sheets/ashes.html">Ashes</a>, and <a href="/sheets/spells.html">Spells</a> sheets can be used to track items in their respective categories.</p>
    <p>For checklists on miscellaneous items, such as gestures, talismans, crystal tears, cookbooks etc., use the <a href="/sheets/key-items.html">Key Items</a> and <a href="/sheets/miscellaneous.html">Miscellaneous</a> sheets.</p>
    <p>If you're considering starting New Game Plus, make sure to check out the <a href="/sheets/new-game-plus.html">New Game Plus</a> sheet to check if you've got everything first.</p>
    <p>You can filter any checklist by using the searchbar to only show display items matching your search.</p>
    <p>The website automatically assigns a color mode based on your system preference, but you can manually swap between themes by clicking the sun/moon icons.</p>
    <h3>What's included in the walkthrough?</h3>
    <p><span class="strong">The walkthrough <span class="red">DOES NOT INCLUDE</span>:</span></p>
    <ul class="omitted">
      <li>Any items that require farming, and respawning plants/crafting materials collected from the environment (e.g., <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rowa+Fruit">Rowa Fruit</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Arteria+Leaf">Arteria Leafs</a> etc.).</li>
      <li>Any Scarabs that respawn, such as Crimson and Cerulean <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Scarab">Teardrop Scarabs</a> that refill your flask charges.</li>
      <li>Any <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Stranded_Souls">Stranded Souls/Ghosts</a> or <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Sword_Monuments">Sword Monuments</a> that players can interact with for lore.</li>

      <li>Any <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Effigies+of+the+Martyr">Martyr Effigies</a> that players can interact with to activate Co-op summon signs for that area.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="included">
      <li>Every single item in the game.</li>

      <li>All sites of grace, gestures, ashes, talismans, and paintings.</li>

      <li>Although the guide does not include materials collected from the environment, all <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Upgrade+Materials">Smithing Stones</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Upgrade+Materials">Gloveworts</a> are included.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Do I have to follow every step in order?</h3>
    <p>Not at all, this project was primarily intended for my cousin and me. Since I am a completionist, I like to make sure that I don't miss a single detail the game has to offer. The <a href="/sheets/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a> represents how I prefer to complete the game, reducing as much backtracking as possible and approaching the game in a natural, but efficient order. Elden Ring is a vast open world game, so if you'd rather play at your own pace, but still don't wanna miss any important questlines, try the <a href="/sheets/questlines.html">Questlines</a> sheet instead. You can always go back and forth, checking off tasks in different order.</p>
    <h3>Will I get all achievements if I follow the guide?</h3>
    <p>Yes, all achievements will be naturally achieved during your playthrough if you're following the <a href="/sheets/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a>. No planning needed! If you want to see what achievements you're missing, I recommend checking out the <a href="/sheets/achievements.html">Achievements</a> sheet.</p>
    <h3>Are there any missable things in Elden Ring?</h3>
    <p>Yes, many things in Elden Ring are missable. While most of them are quest-related, some achievements can be <span class="red">permanently missed</span> until your next playthrough. In the <a href="/sheets/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a> and <a href="/sheets/questlines.html">Questlines</a> sheets, every missable entry is clearly labeled <span class="red">(Missable!)</span>, so you can easily these entries with the search bar. Missable entries that don't give any item or reward are labeled <span class="strong">(Optional)</span>. You won't miss anything if you're following the <a href="/sheets/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a>.</p>
    <h3>How long does it take to 100% complete Elden Ring?</h3>
    <p>A 100% completion playthrough of Elden Ring following this guide, assuming you get all three endings in a single playthrough, typically takes between <span class="strong">60-90 hours</span>, accounting for variables like differences in playstyles and player skill. The <a href="/sheets/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a> is optimized to avoid unnecessary backtracking where possible, while approaching the game in a natural order.</p>
    <h3>What level should I be for each area?</h3>
    <p>The step-by-step checklists provide recommended level ranges for each area. These ranges do not represent the difficulty of an area, but rather the level you're likely to reach naturally when following the walkthroughs. These are suggestions based on typical progression from various of my own playthroughs, and could help you avoid being over- or under-leveled if you want a fair experience.</p>
    <h3>What do I do if I accidentally attacked an NPC?</h3>
    <p>You should <span class="red">never attack or kill an NPC</span> unless it's specifically stated to do so. If you've attacked any NPCs and they've become hostile, then you'll need to travel to the <a href="https://mapgenie.io/elden-ring/maps/the-lands-between?locationIds=165501">Church of Vows</a> in Liurnia and absolve your sins in front of the statue there by using a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Celestial+Dew" class="purple">Celestial Dew</a>. If you've already killed any NPCs, then their questlines are over until you start a new playthrough. Make sure to pick up their <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bell+Bearings">Bell Bearing</a> if they were selling any items.</p>
    <h3>How do I navigate in Elden Ring using compass directions?</h3>
    <p>Elden Ring's compass uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction#/media/File:Brosen_windrose.svg" aria-label="Visual reference to the cardinal directions">primary, intercardinal and secondary-intercardinal directions</a>. I strongly recommend keeping the compass HUD enabled as the guide uses it to provide accurate directions. Below are the tiers used to help provide directions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Primary Cardinal Directions:
        <ul>
          <li>North (N)</li>
          <li>East (E)</li>
          <li>South (S)</li>
          <li>West (W)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Intercardinal Directions:
        <ul>
          <li>Northeast (NE)</li>
          <li>Southeast (SE)</li>
          <li>Southwest (SW)</li>
          <li>Northwest (NW)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Secondary Intercardinal Directions:
        <ul>
          <li>North-Northeast (NNE)</li>
          <li>East-Northeast (ENE)</li>
          <li>East-Southeast (ESE)</li>
          <li>South-Southeast (SSE)</li>
          <li>South-Southwest (SSW)</li>
          <li>West-Southwest (WSW)</li>
          <li>West-Northwest (WNW)</li>
          <li>North-Northwest (NNW)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>For an in-game example, <span class="strong">northeast</span> refers to the midpoint between north and east. Similarly, <span class="strong">north-northeast</span> would then refer to the midpoint between north and northeast.</p>
    <h3>Can I use this for multiple characters?</h3>
    <p>Yes! You can create, edit, and delete profiles using the buttons in the navigation bar. Any stored information is saved separately to your chosen profile.</p>
    <h3>How are the checklists saved?</h3>
    <p>The checklists are saved to your browser's local storage. This means that <span class="red">clearing your browser's cache, will destroy any saved progress</span>.</p>
    <h3>I found an error in the cheat sheet! How can I contribute?</h3>
    <p>It's simple! Just visit the project's repository on <a href="https://github.com/rdmaw/elden-ring-cheat-sheet/issues">GitHub</a>. Check if someone has already reported the same issue and if not, open a new issue detailing the error. If you want to contribute directly, I recommend you fork the project, make your suggested changes and open a pull request.</p>
    <h3>What else do you have planned?</h3>
    <p>Once I'm satisfied with all the sheets, and if there is enough interest, I might consider doing another in-depth one for Sekiro as well.</p>
