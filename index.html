    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>How do I use the cheat sheet?</h3>
    <p>This project is a lightweight collection of checklist sheets, covering everything from single item pickups, NPCs, questlines, bosses, achievements and much more. If this is your first playthrough, I recommend that you complete the game on your own first, then use the cheat sheets for your later playthroughs instead.</p>
    <h4>Open the sheets menu and select a sheet to get started</h4>
    <p>Helpful info about soft caps, upgrade tables, rune item values and more can be found in the <a href="/sheets/resources">Resources</a> sheet.</p>
    <p>In the <a href="/sheets/walkthrough">Walkthrough</a> sheet, you'll find a step-by-step checklist guide through the entire game, covering as much as possible in a single playthrough. If you're not interested in a guided approach, but still want to make sure you don't miss any important questlines or bosses, try the <a href="/sheets/npc-walkthrough">NPC Walkthrough</a> or <a href="/sheets/bosses">Bosses</a> sheets instead.</p>
    <p>The <a href="/sheets/achievements">Achievements</a> sheet can be used to track achievements and legendary equipment.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the <a href="/sheets/armaments">Armaments</a>, <a href="/sheets/armor">Armor</a>, <a href="/sheets/ashes">Ashes</a>, and <a href="/sheets/spells">Spells</a> sheets can be used to track items in their respective categories. For tracking merchant inventories, use the <a href="/sheets/merchants">Merchants</a> sheet.</p>
    <p>For miscellaneous items, such as gestures, talismans, cookbooks etc., check out the <a href="/sheets/key-items">Key Items</a> and <a href="/sheets/miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a> sheets.</p>
    <p>If you're considering starting new game plus, make sure to check out the <a href="/sheets/new-game-plus">New Game+</a> sheet first to see if you've got everything you need.</p>
    <p>Configure color themes, import existing profiles and back up your progress in <a href="/options">Options</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="included">What's included in the walkthrough?</h3>
    <h4>The walkthrough <span class="r">DOES NOT COVER</span>:</h4>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Any items that require farming, or respawning plants and crafting materials collected from the environment (e.g., <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rowa+Fruit">Rowa Fruit</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Arteria+Leaf">Arteria Leafs</a> etc.).</li>
      <li>Any Scarabs that respawn, such as Crimson and Cerulean <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Scarab">Teardrop Scarabs</a> that refill your flasks.</li>
      <li>Any <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Stranded_Souls">Spirits</a> or <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Sword_Monuments">Sword Monuments</a> that players can interact with for lore tidbits.</li>

      <li>Any <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Effigies+of+the+Martyr">Martyr Effigies</a> that players can interact with to activate Co-op summon signs for that area.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Every single item pickup in the game.</li>
      <li>All achievements, NPCs, questlines, bosses and invasions.</li>
      <li>All sites of grace, gestures, ashes, talismans, and paintings.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Do I have to follow every step in order?</h3>
    <p>Not at all, this project was primarily intended for my cousin and me. Since I am a completionist, I like to make sure that I don't miss any details a game has to offer. The <a href="/sheets/walkthrough">Walkthrough</a> represents how I prefer to complete the game, reducing as much backtracking as possible and approaching the game in a natural, but efficient order.</p>
    <p>Elden Ring is a massive game, so if you'd rather play at your own pace, yet don't wanna miss any questlines, try the <a href="/sheets/npc-walkthrough">NPC Walkthrough</a> instead. You can always jump back and forth, checking off tasks in different order, just be mindful that <a href="#missables">doing some things too early</a> might cancel certain questlines.</p>
    <h3>Will I get all achievements if I follow the guide?</h3>
    <p>Yes, all achievements will be naturally achieved during your playthrough if you're following the <a href="/sheets/walkthrough">Walkthrough</a>. No planning needed! If you want to track your achievements and legendary items, check out the <a href="/sheets/achievements">Achievements</a> sheet. You can search for a specific achievement by using the search bar in the walkthrough sheet. Achievement-related steps are <span class="o" style="font-weight: 600;">marked in orange</span>.</p>
    <h3 id="missables">Is there anything missable in Elden Ring?</h3>
    <p>Yes, many things in Elden Ring are missable. While most of them are quest-related, some achievements can be <strong class="r">permanently missed</strong> until your next playthrough. All missable entries are labeled <strong class="r">MISSABLE:</strong>, so you can easily filter these by searching <strong>missable:</strong> in any search bar. Optional or missable entries that don't give any item or reward are labeled <strong>(Optional)</strong>. You won't miss anything if you're following the <a href="/sheets/walkthrough">Walkthrough</a> though.</p>
    <h3>How long does it take to 100% Elden Ring?</h3>
    <p>A 100% completion playthrough of Elden Ring following the walkthrough, assuming you achieve all three endings in a single playthrough, will typically take around <strong>60-90 hours</strong>. I personally dislike backtracking, so the <a href="/sheets/walkthrough">Walkthrough</a> route is heavily optimized to be as efficient as possible, while still approaching the game in a natural progression order.</p>
    <h3>What level should I be for each area?</h3>
    <p>The walkthrough checklists provide recommended level ranges for each area. These ranges don't necessarily represent the difficulty of an area, but rather the level you're likely to reach naturally when following the walkthrough. They are suggestions based on my own playthroughs, and could help you avoid being over- or under-leveled if you want a fairer experience.</p>
    <h3>I accidentally attacked an NPC, what should I do?</h3>
    <p>You should <strong>never attack or kill NPCs</strong> unless it's specifically stated to do so. If you attacked an NPC and they've become hostile, then you can travel to the <a href="https://mapgenie.io/elden-ring/maps/the-lands-between?locationIds=165501">Church of Vows</a> in Liurnia and absolve your sins at the statue inside by using a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Celestial+Dew" class="p">Celestial Dew</a>. If you've killed an NPC, then their questline is over until you start your next playthrough or new game plus. Make sure to pick up their <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bell+Bearings" class="p">Bell Bearing</a> if they were selling items. I also recommend checking the questline of your affected NPC in the <a href="/sheets/questlines">Questlines</a> sheet.</p>
    <h3 id="directions">How do I follow your directions?</h3>
    <p>Elden Ring's compass uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction">cardinal, intercardinal and secondary-intercardinal directions</a>. This means the compass can be broken down into a total of 16 directions:</p>
    <ol class="compass">
      <li><strong>Cardinal Directions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>North (N)</li>
          <li>East (E)</li>
          <li>South (S)</li>
          <li>West (W)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Intercardinal Directions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Northeast (NE)</li>
          <li>Southeast (SE)</li>
          <li>Southwest (SW)</li>
          <li>Northwest (NW)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Secondary Intercardinal Directions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>North-Northeast (NNE)</li>
          <li>East-Northeast (ENE)</li>
          <li>East-Southeast (ESE)</li>
          <li>South-Southeast (SSE)</li>
          <li>South-Southwest (SSW)</li>
          <li>West-Southwest (WSW)</li>
          <li>West-Northwest (WNW)</li>
          <li>North-Northwest (NNW)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>For an in-game example, <strong>northeast</strong> would refer to the middle point between north and east. Using the same logic, <strong>north-northeast</strong> would then refer to the middle point between north and northeast, while <strong>east-northeast</strong> would be the middle point between northeast and east. [<a href="/assets/images/directions.webp" target="_blank">See visual example</a>]</p>
    <h3>Can I use this for multiple characters?</h3>
    <p>Yes! You can create, edit, and delete profiles by using the buttons under profile management in <a href="/options">Options</a>. You can also use the NG+ button to reset progress for the Walkthrough, Questlines, Bosses and New Game+ sheets only. Stored information will be saved to your selected profile.</p>
    <h3>How is my progress saved?</h3>
    <p>Your progress is stored locally in your browser. This means that <strong class="r">clearing your browser's cache will destroy any saved progress</strong>.</p>
    <p>To back up your data, go to <a href="/options">Options</a> and select <strong>Backup as file</strong>. This will export your data to a JSON file. You can then import your data by selecting <strong>Restore from file</strong> and the JSON file you exported. If you're on mobile, I recommend using the clipboard options to sync progress between browsers, as JSON files are not recognized as a valid file type on mobile devices.</p>
    <h3>I found an error in the cheat sheet! How can I contribute?</h3>
    <p>It's very simple! Just <a href="https://github.com/rdmaw/elden-ring-cheat-sheet/issues/new">describe the issue here</a> and click <strong>Create</strong> when you're done. I'll get around to it as soon as I can. You can also reach out to me on discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/VnqRnsbU">@redmaw</a>.</p>
    <h3>What else do you have planned?</h3>
    <p>Once I consider this project fully done and if there's any interest or need, I may consider creating similarly detailed cheat sheets for Sekiro, DS1, Demon's Souls, or Bloodborne.</p>
    <h3>Special Thanks</h3>
