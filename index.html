    <h2>Credits</h2>
    <p>I'd like to thank <a href="https://github.com/zkjellberg">ZKjellberg</a> and <a href="https://github.com/smcnabb">smcnabb</a>, whose original cheat sheets inspired this project. <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Wiki">Fextralife</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Eldenpedia">Eldenpedia</a> are the primary sources used for most of the information here, along with Map Genie's fantastic <a href="https://mapgenie.io/elden-ring/maps/the-lands-between">Elden Ring Map</a> for visualizing item locations. The initial walkthrough sections draw inspiration from FightinCowboy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7RtZMiaOk8gdRf130w4gFYyhstL-5VRh">walkthrough</a> for a head start, making the playthrough much more approachable. Thanks to <a href="https://smalllittleartist.carrd.co">Rin</a> for designing the website's favicon and Open Graph image.</p>
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>How do I use the cheat sheet?</h3>
    <p>This project is a lightweight collection of checklist sheets, covering everything from single item pickups, NPCs, questlines, bosses, achievements and much more. If this is your first playthrough, <strong>I recommend that you complete the game on your own first, then use the cheat sheets for your later playthroughs instead.</strong></p>
    <p>Helpful info about soft caps, upgrade tables, rune item values and more can be found in the <a href="/sheets/resources.html">Resources</a> sheet.</p>
    <p>In the <a href="/sheets/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a> sheet, you'll find a step-by-step checklist guide through the entire game, covering as much as possible in a single playthrough. If you're not interested in a guided approach, but still want to make sure you don't miss any important questlines or bosses, try the <a href="/sheets/questlines.html">Questlines</a> or <a href="/sheets/bosses.html">Bosses</a> sheets instead.</p>
    <p>The <a href="/sheets/achievements.html">Achievements</a> sheet can be used to track what achievements and legendary items you have. Similarly, the <a href="/sheets/armaments.html">Armaments</a>, <a href="/sheets/armor.html">Armor</a>, <a href="/sheets/ashes.html">Ashes</a>, and <a href="/sheets/spells.html">Spells</a> sheets can be used to track items in their respective categories. For tracking bought merchant items and Mausoleum uses, try the <a href="/sheets/merchants.html">Merchants</a> sheet.</p>
    <p>For checklists on miscellaneous items, such as gestures, talismans, crystal tears, cookbooks etc., use the <a href="/sheets/key-items.html">Key Items</a> and <a href="/sheets/miscellaneous.html">Miscellaneous</a> sheets.</p>
    <p>If you're considering starting New Game Plus, make sure to check out the <a href="/sheets/new-game-plus.html">New Game Plus</a> sheet first to see if you've got everything you need.</p>
    <p>Now that you know how the sheets work, <strong>press "q" on your keyboard to open up the Sheets menu</strong> and get started. Any checklist can be filtered by using the search bar to only display items matching your search. You can also swap color themes in the <a href="/options.html">Options</a> page, if you're not a fan of the notebook colors.</p>
    <h3>What's included in the walkthrough?</h3>
    <h4>The walkthrough <span class="r">DOES NOT INCLUDE</span>:</h4>
    <ul class="not">
      <li>Any items that require farming, or respawning plants and crafting materials collected from the environment (e.g., <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rowa+Fruit">Rowa Fruit</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Arteria+Leaf">Arteria Leafs</a> etc.).</li>
      <li>Any Scarabs that respawn, such as Crimson and Cerulean <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Scarab">Teardrop Scarabs</a> that refill your flask charges.</li>
      <li>Any <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Stranded_Souls">Spirits</a> or <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Sword_Monuments">Sword Monuments</a> that players can interact with for small lore tidbits.</li>
      <li>Any <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Usher_of_Death,_Rosus">Gatekeeper Statues</a>, <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanics#Birdseye_Telescope">Birdseye Telescopes</a>, or <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Stakes_of_Marika">Stakes of Marika</a>.</li>
      <li>Any <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Effigies+of+the+Martyr">Martyr Effigies</a> that players can interact with to activate Co-op summon signs for that area.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The walkthrough <span class="g">COVERS</span>:</h4>
    <ul class="incl">
      <li>Every single item pickup in the game.</li>
      <li>All achievements, NPCs, questlines, bosses and invasions.</li>
      <li>All sites of grace, gestures, ashes, talismans, and paintings.</li>
      <li>All Ash of War, Glintstone, Incantation, and Somber <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Scarab">Scarabs</a>.</li>
      <li>All <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment">Scadutree fragments</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revered+Spirit+Ash">Revered Spirit Ashes</a> (DLC).</li>
      <li>Although the walkthrough does not cover materials collected from the environment, all <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Upgrade+Materials">Smithing Stones</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Upgrade+Materials">Gloveworts</a> are included.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Do I have to follow every step in order?</h3>
    <p>Not at all, this project was primarily intended for my cousin and me. Since I am a completionist, I like to make sure that I don't miss a single detail the game has to offer. The <a href="/sheets/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a> represents how I prefer to complete the game, reducing as much backtracking as possible and approaching the game in a natural, but efficient order.</p>
    <p>Elden Ring is a vast open world game, so if you'd rather play at your own pace, but still don't wanna miss any questlines, try the <a href="/sheets/questlines.html">Questlines</a> sheet instead. You can always jump back and forth, checking off tasks in different order, just be mindful that doing <a href="#missable">some things</a> too early might cancel certain questlines.</p>
    <h3>Will I get all achievements if I follow the guide?</h3>
    <p>Yes, all achievements will be naturally achieved during your playthrough if you're following the <a href="/sheets/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a>. No planning needed! If you want to track your achievements and legendary items, I recommend checking out the <a href="/sheets/achievements.html">Achievements</a> sheet.</p>
    <h3 id="missable">Are there any missable things in Elden Ring?</h3>
    <p>Yes, many things in Elden Ring are missable. While most of them are quest-related, some achievements can be <strong class="r">permanently missed</strong> until your next playthrough. All missable entries are labeled <strong class="r">(Missable!)</strong>, so you can easily filter these with the search bar. Missable entries that don't give any item or reward are labeled <strong>(Optional)</strong>. You won't miss anything if you're following the <a href="/sheets/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a>.</p>
    <h3>How long does it take to 100% complete Elden Ring?</h3>
    <p>A 100% completion playthrough of Elden Ring following the walkthrough, assuming you get all three endings in a single playthrough, typically takes between <strong>60-90 hours</strong>. I personally dislike unnecessary backtracking, so the <a href="/sheets/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a> route is heavily optimized to avoid it, while still approaching the game in a natural order.</p>
    <h3>What level should I be for each area?</h3>
    <p>The step-by-step checklists provide recommended level ranges for each area. These ranges don't represent the difficulty of an area, but rather the level you're likely to reach naturally when following the walkthrough. They are suggestions based on my own playthroughs, and could help you avoid being over- or under-leveled if you want a fairer experience.</p>
    <h3>What to do if I accidentally attacked an NPC?</h3>
    <p>You should <strong>never attack or kill NPCs</strong> unless it's specifically stated to do so. If you've attacked an NPC and they've become hostile, then you'll need to travel to the <a href="https://mapgenie.io/elden-ring/maps/the-lands-between?locationIds=165501">Church of Vows</a> in Liurnia and absolve your sins in front of the statue inside by using a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Celestial+Dew" class="p">Celestial Dew</a>. If you've already killed an NPC, then their questline is over until your next playthrough. Make sure to pick up their <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bell+Bearings">Bell Bearing</a> if they were selling any items.</p>
    <h3>How do I follow your directions?</h3>
    <p>Elden Ring's compass uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction">primary, intercardinal and secondary-intercardinal directions</a>. I recommend keeping the compass HUD enabled as the walkthrough uses it to provide accurate directions. Below are the tiers used for directions:</p>
    <ol class="compass">
      <li><strong>Primary Cardinal Directions:</strong>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li>North (N)</li>
          <li>East (E)</li>
          <li>South (S)</li>
          <li>West (W)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Intercardinal Directions:</strong>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li>Northeast (NE)</li>
          <li>Southeast (SE)</li>
          <li>Southwest (SW)</li>
          <li>Northwest (NW)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Secondary Intercardinal Directions:</strong>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li>North-Northeast (NNE)</li>
          <li>East-Northeast (ENE)</li>
          <li>East-Southeast (ESE)</li>
          <li>South-Southeast (SSE)</li>
          <li>South-Southwest (SSW)</li>
          <li>West-Southwest (WSW)</li>
          <li>West-Northwest (WNW)</li>
          <li>North-Northwest (NNW)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>For an in-game example, <strong>northeast</strong> would refer to the midpoint between north and east. Similarly, <strong>north-northeast</strong> would refer to the middle point between north and northeast.</p>
    <h3>Can I use this for multiple characters?</h3>
    <p>Yes! You can create, edit, and delete profiles by using the profile buttons in the <a href="/options.html">Options</a> page. Additionally, you can use the NG+ button to only reset progress for the Walkthrough, Questlines, Bosses and New Game+ sheets. Any stored information is saved separately to your selected profile.</p>
    <h3>How are the checklists saved?</h3>
    <p>The checklists are stored locally in your browser. This means that <strong class="r">clearing your browser's cache will permanently delete any saved progress</strong>. In the <a href="/options.html">Options</a> page you can export your profiles as backup or import them to sync your progress between devices.</p>
    <h3>I found an error in the cheat sheet! How can I contribute?</h3>
    <p>It's actually very easy! Just <a href="https://github.com/rdmaw/elden-ring-cheat-sheet/issues/new">describe the issue here</a>, and I'll get around to it as soon as I can. If you know your way around code, then you could fork the repo and open a pull request with your suggested changes.</p>
    <h3>What else do you have planned?</h3>
    <p>Once I'm satisfied with all the sheets, and if there is enough interest, I might consider creating an in-depth cheat sheet for Sekiro as well.</p>
