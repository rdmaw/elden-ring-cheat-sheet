## Elden Ring Cheat Sheet

An Elden Ring cheat sheet and guide for 100% completion, including all items, achievements, NPCs, quests, bosses and more, including the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC.
Inspired by the previous cheat sheets made by [Zachary Kjellberg](https://github.com/zkjellberg) and [Stephen McNabb](https://github.com/smcnabb).

The guide does not include common plants and crafting materials picked directly off the ground. However, upgrade materials, such as Smithing Stones and Gloveworts are included.
