      <label for="playthrough_1_1">(Optional) Pick any starting class you want. If you're not sure, I recommend starting with <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Vagabond">Vagabond</a> or <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Samurai">Samurai</a>, as they have good starting stats for most builds.</label>

    <li>
      <input type="checkbox" id="playthrough_1_2">
      <label for="playthrough_1_2">(Optional) For a completionist's run, I recommend starting with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" class="purple">Stonesword Key x2</a> keepsake. They are necessary items for full completion and two of them costs at least <span class="strong">4,000 runes</span>, meaning you won't need to buy an extra two for an expensive price in the early game. You could also pick the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lands+Between+Rune">Lands Between Rune</a> for <span class="strong">3,000 runes</span>, but if you have to buy <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" class="purple">Stonesword Keys</a> at any point, then I think picking those will give you greater value in the long run.</label>

          <input type="checkbox" id="playthrough_1_3">
          <label for="playthrough_1_3">Note: Don't pick the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golden+Seed">Golden Seed</a> if you're following this guide, as it will become obsolete almost immediately after the first few sections. No starting class equipment or keepsake is missable, so go with whichever one you like!</label>
